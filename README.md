# Parallel-Computing
Improving the Bucket Sort algorithm with a full implementation of the Thread and Locks algorithm.

Statistics of the Thread and Lock algorithm on different input sizes and cores are collected, analyzed and discussed. Bottlenecks are identified and explained.

Applicable concurrent data structures have been tested and experiments with task granularity and problem decomposition support the claim for an (near) optimal implementation.
